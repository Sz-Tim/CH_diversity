- **OPFO PUBLIC DESIGN**
- **INTERPRETATION OF LAMBDA AS UPPER BOUND**
- "However, grid cell size also affects the interpretation of occupancy as a state variable (Efford & Dawson, 2012). We consider a grid cell occupied if it overlaps with the home range of at least one individual of the species in question at some time during the period of data collection. For constant home range sizes, occupancy tends to increase with increasing grid cell size. Occupancy estimates are therefore specific to grid cell size."
- "Even though grid cell size is clearly defined in most atlas projects, only very small grid cells can in practice be searched comprehensively during a single visit. When the entire grid cell is not searched for a particular checklist, then the species-level detec- tion probability for that checklist/occasion can be written as the product of Pr(species is locally present in sampled area|presence in sample unit) and Pr(species detected|local presence in sampled area). Random selection of sampled areas in each checklist within grid cells guards against problems with bias, but random selection can not always be undertaken."

- **SDM STACKING, RICHNESS MODELS**
- **EXPECTED BIAS BY METHOD**
- Comparison of stacked SDMs and macroecological models directly predicting richness
- 14k spp of amphibians, birds, mammals at global extent
- Both methods were strongly correlated
- Both methods under-predicted variability in richness across space
- Conclusion: they're different, but both are ok
- BUT they use a 0.5-degree spatial resolution, and compare models to 'extent-of-occurrence' range maps. Maybe ok at a broad spatial resolution, but less so as cell size decreases

- **SPATIAL SCALE OF COVARIATES**
- Comparison of stacked SDMs and macroecological models
- Argues for stacking by sum(pr) instead of threshold
- Methods generate similar predictions
- Both models are biased toward flatter richness, suggests 'regression dilution' / 'attenuation' as cause, where error in predictors leads to overestimation at low-suitability sites and underestimation at high-suitability sites

- For species with low level of presences: Gaussian Markov Random Field
- INLA (integrated nested Laplace approximation) which only works with Gaussian distributions and which I don't understand, but it allows for approximation of the posterior probabilities without MCMC
- Evaluate with WAIC, CPO, and AUC
- R-INLA is still pretty new and limited in its capabilities

- **SCALE-DEPENDENT SPECIES RESPONSES**
- **JUSTIFICATION FOR COMMUNITY MODELS vs Ind. SPP**
- Bayesian scale-selecting multispecies occupancy model, which estimates the scale of response
- Quantify covariates at multiple spatial scales, use a parameter to select which column to use in each iteration, then calculate selected scale based on posterior for that parameter
- But this can only be done for particular covariates, and including a new parameter for each species x covariate quickly becomes untenable...
- Cool idea for satellite-based covariates

- If many species are undetected (>15-20%), predictions can be poor, and typical priors can accentuate the overestimation
- Missing predictors can result in richness underestimation
- For occupancy models, but plausible that it applies
- "We therefore suggest that large estimates with broad credible intervals should be interpreted as an indication that species might have been missed, rather than as a reliable indication of species numbers."
- Sensitivity to low-detectability species
- Be realistic about the limitations of the conclusions and applications

- Use of common env. conditions was the main predictor of abundance and occupancy (spp using most common conditions were abundant and widespread) 
- Niche BREADTH had less to do with it

- No clear recommendation for filtering, since the best method depended on the species

- UK comparison of 2 week CS collections vs 40-yr structured dataset
- CS = urban-biased
- SDMs can be comparable

- Compared models fit with worldclim vs interpolated remote sensing data, then across different climate projections
- Big differences between the fitting datasets -- bigger effect than the prediction datasets (covariate effects were different)
- Baseline dataset is really important to consider

- **OCCUPANCY MODELS**
- Simulation-based comparison of multispecies occupancy models with iChao2 richness estimater, plus a real dataset 
- Both are accurate unless mean occupancy is low
- With low mean occupancy, MSOM overestimated S
- More uncertainty in MSOM, but more like over-confident iChao2

- **JOINT SDMs**
- **SPECIES CORRELATIONS**
- Imperfect detection and species correlations improved estimation of occupancy, betas, and species correlations
- Use latent site-level covariates (l[T]) with species-level slopes (theta[i]), such that log(lambda) = X*beta + l*theta + error, and sigma2[i] = 1 - sum(theta[i]^2), and then the correlation matrix is theta * t(theta) + diag(sigma[i]). 
- BUT Needed n/2 latent variables to represent the species correlation matrix. Maybe not realistic for a community of 80 with this many sites...
- "It is important to point out that although co-occurrence models can separate out environmental correlation that is explained by covariates that are included in the model from residual correlation, these models cannot tell us if the residual correlation is caused by missing environmental covariates or by true interactions among species, such as competition, predation, or mutualism."

- "Bayesian p-values and posterior predictive checks (Gelman, Meng, & Stern, 1996) provide a means of evaluating fit when using Bayesian approaches (see Kéry & Royle, 2016). Diagnostic plots of residuals provide an alternative approach to assessing model fit. Warton, Stoklosa, Guillera-Arroita, MacKenzie and Welsh (2017) recommended computation of a specific kind of residual (Dunn & Smyth, 1996) based on the observed number of sites with detections. An alternative approach that again focuses on residuals is a cumulative sum (CUSUM) residual plot (see MacKenzie, 2002). For an occupancy CUSUM residual, MacKenzie et al. (2018) recommend using the expected value of zi, conditional on the detection history, with estimated occupancy parameters, ̂??i , as “observed" values. When placed in some meaningful order (e.g., based on a covariate rank), CUSUM plots of residuals can provide insight into not only the utility of a covariate for modelling but also the nature of the covariate relationship (e.g., linear vs. quadratic). As with the modelling of spatial autocorrelation, assessment of model fit is an ongoing area of research in occupancy modelling."
