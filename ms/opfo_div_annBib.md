- Methods and recommendations for occupancy models
- Consequences of decisions (spatial resolution, effort)
- **USE FOR OPFO PUBLIC DESIGN**
- **USE FOR INTERPRETATION OF LAMBDA AS UPPER BOUND**
- "However, grid cell size also affects the interpretation of occu-
pancy as a state variable (Efford & Dawson, 2012). We consider a grid cell occupied if it overlaps with the home range of at least one individual of the species in question at some time during the period of data collection. For constant home range sizes, occupancy tends to increase with increasing grid cell size. Occupancy estimates are therefore specific to grid cell size."
- "Even though grid cell size is clearly defined in most atlas projects, only very small grid cells can in practice be searched comprehensively during a single visit. When the entire grid cell is not searched for a particular checklist, then the species-level detec- tion probability for that checklist/occasion can be written as the product of Pr(species is locally present in sampled area|presence in sample unit) and Pr(species detected|local presence in sampled area). Random selection of sampled areas in each checklist within grid cells guards against problems with bias, but random selection can not always be undertaken."

- **USE FOR MULTINOM JUSTIFICATION**
- Comparison of potential methods for data filtering and corrections for recorder activity, using simulated data

# Bayes & Model Selection

### Altwegg2019
Altwegg, R., and Nichols, J. D. (2019). Occupancy models for citizen-science data. Methods Ecol. Evol. 10, 8–21. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13090.
- "Bayesian p-values and posterior predictive checks (Gelman, Meng, & Stern, 1996) provide a means of evaluating fit when using Bayesian approaches (see Kéry & Royle, 2016). Diagnostic plots of residuals provide an alternative approach to assessing model fit. Warton, Stoklosa, Guillera-Arroita, MacKenzie and Welsh (2017) recommended computation of a specific kind of residual (Dunn & Smyth, 1996) based on the observed number of sites with detections. An alternative approach that again focuses on residuals is a cumulative sum (CUSUM) residual plot (see MacKenzie, 2002). For an occupancy CUSUM resid- ual, MacKenzie et al. (2018) recommend using the expected value of zi, conditional on the detection history, with estimated occupancy parameters, ̂??i , as “observed" values. When placed in some meaningful order (e.g., based on a covariate rank), CUSUM plots of residuals can provide insight into not only the utility of a covariate for modelling but also the nature of the covariate relationship (e.g., linear vs. quadratic). As with the modelling of spatial autocorrelation, assessment of model fit is an ongoing area of research in occupancy modelling."
