# Issues to resolve  

1. Any method to control for the same colony being sampled twice at different flags from the same plot? Using data as-is would over-estimate colony density when that happens, but lumping to presence/absence at the plot-level would reduce the alignment of a poisson-distributed variable, as well as underestimate the abundance of species with smaller colonies (e.g., multiple Leptothorax in separate branches).  

2. Error is smaller for Lambda and lambda in the testing subset... That seems odd.
